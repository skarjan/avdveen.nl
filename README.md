## a front end developer's portfolio website. 

### Summary
This is a homepage ultimately designed to showcase my skills. In order for that to happen, said skills need to be aquired. This is one of those many attempts. 

### Goals

#### Improve load times

Currently I pass the scores easily in 3 out of the 4 core metrics in Web Vitals Analytics by Google. 

- Accessibility (96)
- Best Practices (93)
- SEO (92)

The 4th is performance and depending on the connection varies wildly.
From 90+ locally to a score of 28 on a public wifi connection.

It seems I can speed things up by appropriatly sizing the images.
Looking to read up on this. MDN seems to have a good article. 

#### Add English version

Currently everything is in Dutch. Acknowledged with the fact that 'ENG' language selector is disabled. 
I need to sit down one afternoon and get it done. 

#### Ã€dd a projects section

I'd like to demo more of my skills with additional projects. Like the 'Bootstrap Form Validation' I did.
